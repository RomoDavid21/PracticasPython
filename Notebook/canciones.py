Bones="""
Gimme gimme gimme some time to think
I’m in the bathroom looking at me
Face in the mirror is all I need
Wait until the reaper takes my life
Never gonna get me out alive
I will live a thousand million lives

My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?

I got this feeling yeah you know
Where I’m losing all control
Cause there’s magic in my bones
I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
Cause there’s magic in my bones

Playing with a stick of dynamite
There was never grey in black and white
There was never wrong till there was right
Feeling like a boulder hurdling
Seeing all the vultures circling
Burning in the flames I’m working in
Turning in a bed that’s darkening

My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?

I got this feeling yeah you know
Where I’m losing all control
Cause there’s magic in my bones
I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
Cause there’s magic in my bones

Cause there’s magic in my bones

Look in the mirror of my mind
Turning the pages of my life
Walking the path so many paced a million times
Drown out the voices in the air
Leaving the ones that never cared
Picking the pieces up and building to the sky

My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?

I got this feeling yeah you know
Where I’m losing all control
Cause there’s magic in my bones
I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
Cause there’s magic in my bones

There goes my mind, don’t mind
There goes my mind
There goes my mind, don’t mind
There goes my mind
Cause there’s magic in my bones

Look out for yourself

I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I’m searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world, that was smiling when I turned
Tell you you’re the greatest
But once you turn they hate us

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Look out for yourself
My enemy
Look out for yourself
But I’m ready

Your words up on the wall, as you’re praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls, and the names that I’ve been called
I stack it in my mind, and I’m waiting for the time
When I show you what it’s like, to be words spit in a mic
Tell you you’re the greatest
But once you turn they hate us

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Smell the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Look out for yourself
My enemy
Look, look, look, look, look out for yourself

_JID verse_

Yeah
Uh, look, okay
I’m hoping that somebody pray for me
I’m praying that somebody hope for me
I’m staying where nobody ‘posed to be
P-p-posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever just let me know
The road is long so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy’s on my trail
My energy unavailable
Imma tell ‘em hasta luego
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I’ve been outta shape
Thinkin’ out the box
I’m an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause Catastrophe and it matters, more because I had it not,
Had I  thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shockin’ they wanted static 
With precision I’m automatic quarterback
I ain’t talkin’ sacking
Pack it pack it up
I don’t panic
Batter batter up
Who the baddest
It don’t matter
Cause we at ya throat

__

Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy

They say pray it away, I swear, I’ll never be a Saint, no way
My enemy
They say pray it away, I swear, I’ll never be a Saint
Look out for yourself

Soy
La pregunta del millón
Siempre la interrogación
No respondas
Que sí, porque sí
¿Y qué?
¿Qué podrías tú decir?
Si yo no te voy a oír
No me entiendes
Y nunca seré lo que esperas de mí
Jamás
Ya me vas a conocer
Niño y hombre puedo ser
No me uses
Y apartes de ti
Y di
¿Cómo alguien aprendió?
Lo que nadie le enseñó
No me entienden
No estoy aquí
Y yo solo quiero ser real
Y sentir el mundo igual
Que los otros
Seguir siempre así
¿Por qué yo tendría que cambiar?
Nadie más lo va a intentar
Y no entienden
Que sigo aquí
Y tú
Ves lo que ellos nunca ven
Te daría el cien por cien
Me conoces
Y ya no hay temor
Yo
Mostraría lo que soy
Si tú vienes donde voy
No me alcanzan
Si eres mi amigo mejor
¿Qué sabrán del mal y el bien?
Yo no soy lo que ven
Todo un mundo durmiendo, y yo sigo soñando, ¿por qué?
Sus palabras susurran mentiras que nunca creeré
Y yo solo quiero ser real
Y sentir el mundo igual
Que los otros
Por ellos, por mí
¿Por qué yo tendría que cambiar?
Nadie más lo va a intentar
Estoy solo
Y sigo aquí
Solo yo
Estoy aquí
Sigo aquí
Sigo aquí

I am the monster you created
You ripped out all my parts
And worst of all, for me to live, I gotta kill the part of me that saw
That I needed you more
I hope you know we had everything
And you broke me and left these pieces
I want you to hurt like you hurt me today and
I want you to lose like I lose when I play what could have been
Oh, what could have been
Why don't you love who I am?
What we could have been
I am your ghost, a fallen angel
You ripped out all my parts
I couldn't care what invention you made me
'Cause I, I was meant to be yours
I hope you know we had everything
And you broke me and left these pieces
